# Teasing out detrital and chemical remanence in hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks: insights from fluvial intraclasts

*Nicholas Swanson-Hysell, Department of Earth and Planetary Science, UC Berkeley*

In November of 2018, just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday, I had the opportunity to visit the Institute for Rock Magnetism as a visiting fellow. This visiting fellowship was focused on furthering a study of siltstone intraclasts within particularly well-preserved fluvial sediments of the 1.1-billion-year-old Freda Formation from the North American Midcontinent Rift. As always, this visit was intellectually invigorating and involved the acquisition of high-quality data on IRM instrumentation. Peat Solheid, Mike Jackson, and Dario Bilardello were there to provide excellent technical support and advice on experimental design. Discussions with them, and with Josh Feinberg and Bruce Moskowitz, provided insight on rock magnetic data interpretation. In this visiting fellow report, I will seek to provide the main take-aways from this study which will include discussing thermal demagnetization data that were developed in the UC Berkeley Paleomagnetism lab prior to the fellowship.

As those immersed in rock magnetism are well aware, there is a long history of leveraging the magnetization of hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks to gain insight into the behavior of the ancient geomagnetic field and the paleogeographic positions of sedimentary basins. There is an accompanying long history (at times dubbed the "red bed controversy") of seeking to constrain the age of the ancient remanence. The difficulty in doing so arises from the reality that hematite within sedimentary rocks can have two sources: (1) detrital grains that are within the sediment at the time of deposition and acquired a detrital remanent magnetization (DRM); and (2) grains that grow in situ after the sediment had been deposited and acquired a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM). This study was initiated with the goal of developing paleogeographic constraints from the package of sedimentary rocks that post-date the underlying volcanic rocks from which paleomagnetic poles have lead to a late Mesoproterozoic apparent polar wander path for North America. Constraining the age of the remanence is critical to this effort.

A common approach to classify hematite grains within red beds is into a fine-grained pigmentary population, typically interpreted to have formed within the sediment, and a coarser-grained population that has been referred to in the literature as “specularite” (Butler, 1992; Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012). Tauxe et al. (1980) showed that sediments with abundant red pigmentary hematite in the Miocene Siwalik Group had lower thermal unblocking temperatures than gray samples dominated by coarser-grained specular hematite. An additional approach taken by Tauxe et al. (1980), and other workers going back to the work of Collinson (1965), is to preferentially remove fine-grained pigmentary hematite through immersion in HCl acid. Paired chemical and thermal demagnetization data have been interpreted to show that pigmentary hematite removal coincides with removal of hematite with lower unblocking temperatures. These data support the interpretation that coarser grains more resistant to dissolution in acid correspond with those that carry remanence to the highest unblocking temperatures (Bilardello & Kodama, 2010; Tauxe et al., 1980) although simultaneous dissolution of fine and coarser hematite can occur (Jiang et al., 2017). Observations such as these have led to the practice of defining the characteristic remanent magnetization from hematite-bearing sediments as that held by the highest unblocking temperatures (Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012). Additional lines of evidence from field and lab based studies have supported this approach. For example, in the well-studied Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, remanence removed up to ∼660◦C has uniform polarity and fails a fold test while the component removed upward of 670◦C is dual polarity, was acquired before folding, and is interpreted as a primary magnetization (DiVenere & Opdyke, 1991; Kent & Opdyke, 1985). The work of Jiang et al. (2015) on the thermal demagnetization characteristics of hematite experimentally synthesized through ferrihydrite–hematite conversion provides additional support for discriminating between CRM and DRM on the basis of unblocking temperature. Nevertheless, the primary versus secondary nature of micron-scale specularite grains that carry the high-unblocking temperature remanence has been one of the largest sources of contention in the red bed controversy (Tauxe et al., 1980; Butler, 1992; Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012).

It can be difficult to reliably constrain the relative age of hematite within sedimentary rocks given that traditional paleomagnetic field tests can be ambiguous. A structural fold test can constrain whether remanence acquisition occurred prior to folding, but millions of years have typically passed between deposition and tilting. Dual-polarity directions through a sedimentary succession are often interpreted to indicate that the remanence records primary or near-primary magnetization. However, hematite growth could occur after deposition during a protracted period over which the geomagnetic field was in both reversed and normal polarities. What is needed to most confidently address the timing of remanence acquisition is a process that reorients the sediment before it has been fully lithified. One such process is when intraclasts composed of the lithology of interest have been liberated and redeposited within the depositional environment. Such intraclasts can provide significant insight into whether magnetization was acquired before or after reorientation as was done in Tauxe et al. (1980) and Opdyke and DiVenere (2004). While such clasts can be difficult to find and sample, we luckily found excellent exposures of siltstone intraclasts that were eroded from a coexisting lithofacies and redeposited within channel sandstone of the Freda Formation along the Bad River in northern Wisconsin (Fig. 1).

High-resolution thermal demagnetization data on these clasts that we developed in our paleomagnetism lab at Berkeley constrain the timing of hematite acquisition by revealing a component that formed prior to the erosion of the clasts within the depositional environment and another component that formed following their redeposition (Fig. 2). The primary component that unblocked in a narrow temperature range between 665 and 690◦C has dispersed directions among the intraclasts indicating that the magnetization was rotated along with the clasts in the depositional environment. The secondary component unblocked over a broad temperature range from 100 up to 650◦C or higher and has a consistent direction throughout the intraclasts indicating that it formed following deposition. During the visiting fellowship at the IRM, backfield demagnetization experiments were conducted on a Princeton Measurements vibrating sample magnetometer and used to develop coercivity spectra. These spectra were  modeled using the Max UnMix software package (Maxbauer et al., 2016; Figure 3). These spectra are well fit with two log-normal distributions associated with two populations of grains. One population has a median coercivity of ∼300 mT and a distribution that extends from the lowest to the highest coercivities. The other population has a higher median coercivity of ∼700 mT and a coercivity distribution that is limited to the high-coercivity range (Figure 3). The high-coercivity phase can be considered to correspond with the plateau of high coercivities observed for single-domain hematite in the ∼10 to ∼100-𝜇m range (Özdemir & Dunlop, 2014; Fig. 4). The spread in coercivities associated with the lower coercivity population is consistent with the lower coercivity values that are associated with finer-grained hematite; the coercivity of hematite becomes progressively lower for grains that are smaller than 300 nm in diameter (Özdemir & Dunlop, 2014; Fig. 4).

Given the directional consistency of the mid-temperature component among the intraclasts (Fig. 2), this component must have dominantly formed as a chemical remanent magnetization after the intraclasts were redeposited in the channel. Chemical remanent magnetization acquisition by pigmentary hematite would have occurred as hematite grains grew to sizes above the superparamagnetic to stable single-domain transition resulting in the wide range of unblocking temperatures that is observed. Low-temperature hysteresis experiments conducted at the IRM revealed an increase in remanent magnetization at low-temperature suggesting the presence of a population of superparamagnetic grains. The coercivity spectra are consistent with a population of hematite that has a wide coercivity range extending from low coercivities up to high coercivities (the green component in the unmixing models of Figure 3) which is likely associated with a population of authigenic hematite nanoparticles. In contrast, the sharp unblocking temperature close to the Néel temperature of the high-temperature component indicates that it is dominantly held by hematite grains that are >400 nm (based on Néel relaxation theory; Figure 4) such as the silt-sized hematite grains observed petrographically (Figure 1). The high-coercivity population within the coercivity spectra (purple curves in Figure 3) is consistent with this grain-size interpretation (Figure 4).

The differential unblocking temperature spectra of the two components within the Freda intraclasts provide strong support for the argument that chemical and detrital remanent magnetization can be distinguished due to detrital remanence unblocking at the highest temperatures. However, the Freda intraclast data also show that while the detrital remanent magnetization can be well isolated at temperatures as low as 650 ◦C (specimen BRIC.31a in Figure 2), the chemical remanent magnetization thermal unblocking spectra can overlap with that of the detrital remanence and extend up to temperatures closer to the Néel temperature (specimen BRIC.41a in Figure 2). Therefore, to isolate primary remanence in red beds, best practice should be to proceed with very high resolution thermal demagnetization steps above 600 ◦C, and particularly above 650 ◦C. Characteristic remanence magnetization directions associated with hematite that are fit to components that span a wide range of unblocking temperatures including those lower than ∼650 ◦C are likely convolving a pigmentary chemical remanence and a detrital remanence held by larger grains.

Overall, the data support the interpretation that magnetizations of hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks held by >400-nm grains that unblock close to the Néel temperature are more likely to record magnetization from the time of deposition. Hydrodynamic sorting associated with the delivery of detrital hematite will lead to a narrower and coarser size distribution of grains than that of authigenic pigmentary hematite growth. This primary magnetization can be successfully isolated from co-occurring authigenic hematite through thermal demagnetization provided such thermal demagnetization is preformed at high-resolution.

the hammer head, which is topped by a bed of trough cross-stratified coarse-grained sandstone with horizons of
siltstone intraclasts. The hammer is 40 cm long. (b) A scan of a thin section of the BRIC.26 intraclast (upper half of image) and the coarse sand matrix (lower half of image). The red color of the intraclast is due to pigmentary hematite. (c) Backscatter electron image of the siltstone clast from the region of the white box in (b). The light-colored detrital grains that are labeled with arrows were confirmed to be hematite through electron backscatter diffraction.

Figure 2: Paleomagnetic data from intraclasts and in-place rocks of the same lithology reveal a mid-temperature component (green symbols) that typically unblocks prior to 655◦C and a high-temperature component (purple symbols) that typically unblocks between 655 and 687◦C. These components are present as varying fractions of the overall remanence. The high-temperature component directions from the clasts are dispersed indicating that the magnetization was acquired before the clasts were ripped up in the depositional environment. The mid-temperature component directions are clustered indicated that the magnetization was acquired in the clasts as a chemical remanence following deposition. The in-place siltstone show similar, but distinct directions between the two components consistent with the mid-temperature component being acquired following burial during an interval of rapid North American plate motion.

Figure 3: Coercivity spectra developed from backfield demagnetization curves on BRIC intraclast specimens with the points being the data. The data were modeled using log-Gaussian distributions implemented with the Max UnMix software package (Maxbauer et al., 2016). The coercivity spectra can be well explained with two distributions: the higher coercivity distribution in purple and the lower coercivity distribution in green.

The higher coercivity population from Figure 3 corresponds to the larger grain sizes than the lower coercivity component associated with the chemical remanence.
