# Teasing out detrital and chemical remanence in hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks

*Nicholas Swanson-Hysell, Department of Earth and Planetary Science, UC Berkeley*

In November of 2018, just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday, I had the opportunity to visit the Institute for Rock Magnetism as a visiting fellow. This visiting fellowship was focused on furthering a study of siltstone intraclasts within particularly well-preserved fluvial sediments of the 1.1-billion-year-old Freda Formation from the North American Midcontinent Rift. As always, this visit was intellectually invigorating and involved the acquisition of high-quality data on IRM instrumentation. In this visiting fellow report, I will seek to provide the main take-aways from this study which will include discussing thermal demagnetization data that were developed in the UC Berkeley Paleomagnetism lab prior to the fellowship.

As those immersed in rock magnetism are well aware, there is a long history of leveraging the magnetization of hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks to gain insight into the behavior of the ancient geomagnetic field and the paleogeographic positions of sedimentary basins. There is an accompanying long history (at times dubbed the "red bed controversy") of seeking to constrain the age of the ancient remanence. The difficulty in doing so arises from the reality that hematite within sedimentary rocks can have two sources: (1) detrital grains that are within the sediment at the time of deposition and acquired a detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) and (2) grains that grow in situ after the sediment has been deposited and acquired a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM). This study was initiated with the goal of developing paleogeographic constraints from the package of sedimentary rocks that post-dates the underlying volcanic rocks from which paleomagnetic poles constrain the late Mesoproterozoic Keweenawan Track. Constraining the age of the remanence is critical to this effort.

A common approach to classify hematite grains within red beds is into a fine-grained pigmentary population, typically interpreted to have formed within the sediment, and a coarser-grained population that has been referred to in the literature as “specularite” (Butler, 1992; Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012). Tauxe et al. (1980) showed that sediments with abundant red pigmentary hematite in the Miocene Siwalik Group had lower thermal unblocking temperatures than gray samples dominated by coarser-grained specular hematite. An additional approach taken by Tauxe et al. (1980), and other workers going back to the work of Collinson (1965), is to preferentially remove fine-grained pigmentary hematite through immersion in HCl acid. Paired chemical and thermal demagnetization have been interpreted to show that removal of pigmentary hematite coincides with removal of hematite associated with lower unblocking temperatures. These data support the interpretation that coarser grains that are more resistant to dissolution in acid correspond with those that carry remanence to the highest unblocking temperatures (Bilardello & Kodama, 2010a; Tauxe et al., 1980) although simultaneous dissolution of fine and coarser hematite can occur (Jiang et al., 2017). Observations such as these have led to the practice of defining the characteristic remanent magnetization from hematite-bearing sediments as that held by the highest unblocking temperatures (Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012). Additional lines of evidence from field and lab based studies have supported this approach. For example, in the well-studied Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, remanence removed up to ∼660◦C has uniform polarity and fails a fold test while the component removed upward of 670◦C is dual polarity, was acquired before folding, and is interpreted as a primary magnetization (DiVenere & Opdyke, 1991; Kent & Opdyke, 1985). The work of Jiang et al. (2015) on the thermal demagnetization characteristics of hematite experimentally synthesized through ferrihydrite–hematite conversion provides additional support for discriminating between CRM and DRM on the basis of unblocking temperature. Nevertheless, the primary versus secondary nature of micron-scale specularite grains that carry the high-unblocking temperature remanence has been one of the largest sources of contention in the red bed controversy (Tauxe et al., 1980; Butler, 1992; Van Der Voo & Torsvik, 2012).

It can be difficult to reliably constrain the relative age of hematite within sedimentary rocks given that traditional paleomagnetic field tests can be ambiguous. A structural fold test can constrain whether remanence acquisition occurred prior to folding, but millions of years have typically passed between deposition and tilting. Dual-polarity directions through a sedimentary succession are often interpreted to indicate that the remanence records primary or near-primary magnetization; however, hematite growth could occur significantly after deposition during a protracted period over which the geomagnetic field was in both reversed and normal polarities. What is needed to most confidently address the timing of remanence acquisition is a process that reorients the sediment before it has been fully lithified. One such process is when intraclasts composed of the lithology of interest that have been liberated and redeposited within the depositional environment. Sediments that have undergone reorienting processes within the depositional environment can provide significant insight into whether magnetization was acquired before or after reorientation as was done in Tauxe et al. (1980) and Opdyke and DiVenere (2004). Such clasts can be difficult to find and sample. Luckily, we found excellent exposures of siltstone intraclasts that were eroded from a coexisting lithofacies and redeposited within channel sandstone of the Freda Formation.

High-resolution thermal demagnetization data on these clasts that we developed in our paleomagnetism lab at Berkeley constrained the timing of hematite acquisition by revealing a primary component that formed prior to the erosion of the clasts within the depositional environment and a secondary component that formed following their redeposition. The component that unblocked in a narrow temperature range between 665 and 690◦C while the secondary component unblocked over a broad temperature range from 100 up to 650◦C or higher. The reorientation of the intraclasts provides a
