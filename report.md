# Teasing out detrital and chemical remanence in hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks

*Nicholas Swanson-Hysell, Department of Earth and Planetary Science, UC Berkeley*

In November of 2018, just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday, I had the opportunity to visit the Institute for Rock Magnetism as a visiting fellow. This visiting fellowship was focused on furthering a study of siltstone intraclasts within particularly well-preserved fluvial sediments of the 1.1-billion-year-old Freda Formation from the North American Midcontinent Rift. As always, this visit was intellectually invigorating and involved the acquisition of high-quality data on IRM instrumentation. In this visiting fellow report, I will seek to provide the main take-aways from this study which will include discussing thermal demagnetization data that were developed in the UC Berkeley Paleomagnetism lab prior to the fellowship.

As those immersed in rock magnetism are well aware, there is a long history of leveraging the magnetization of hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks to gain insight into the behavior of the ancient geomagnetic field and the paleogeographic positions of sedimentary basins. There is an accompanying long history (at times dubbed the "red bed controversy") of seeking to constrain the age of the ancient remanence. The difficulty in doing so arises from the reality that hematite within sedimentary rocks can have two sources: (1) detrital grains that are within the sediment at the time of deposition and acquired a detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) and (2) grains that grow in situ after the sediment has been deposited and acquired a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM). This study was initiated with the goal of developing paleogeographic constraints from the package of sedimentary rocks that post-dates the underlying volcanic rocks from which paleomagnetic poles constrain the late Mesoproterozoic Keweenawan Track. Constraining the age of the remanence is critical to this effort.
